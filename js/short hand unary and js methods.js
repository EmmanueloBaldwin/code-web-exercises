// SHORTHAND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

// += and -=

//var name = "Casey"; // What if I want my full name?

// We could say:

//name = name + "Edwards"; // But this seems a little terse, let's make it shorter

//name += " Edwards";

//console.log(name);

//// MINI EXERCISE
// // TODO: Refactor the mini exercise we did earlier on arithmetic operators to use variables and their related shorthand assignment operators, then log out the result
// //  ie:
// //     var result = 5;
// //     console.log(result += 1);
